// *** METHODS ***
// Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct, or an enum, or a trait object. Their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
